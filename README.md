mediks dotfiles
---------------

This repo is a collection of my dotfiles that I want to share (actually no, I just backup it here).
Let it inspire you or fork it. 

Install
-------

You can install my dotfiles by running the following command:

./install.sh

However, it will remove you dotfiles in your homedirectory (will fix this soon). Never do this as root. 

Uninstall
---------

Uninstallation is easy, run the command ./uninstall.sh and it 
should remove all symlinks to the dotfiles.
