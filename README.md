# dotfiles

## Why this is needed

This is a repository of my prefered configuration files. It is easy to
organize my dotfiles into categories. I don't need any fancy bootstrap script,
and it fits my needs.

### Features
* Easy organization of my dotfiles
* Automatically downloads and installs Vundle + other plugins to Vim
* It just works

## Installation
Install it by cloning this repo into your preferred folder (don't move around
the folder if you want this to still work...)

After you cloned this repo. Please run `./bootstrap.sh` to install all dotfiles
kept in `confs/` and `/include`.  And that's it.

## Usage (how the directory structure works)
If I were in a coma and I forgot how to put all my configuration files: then
this is for you. 

It may be confusing at first, but all configuration files kept in `confs/` *must*
be in a directory. In contrast to "dot-directory-files" should live in `include/`.
Please look at my current directory structure if this seems confusing.
